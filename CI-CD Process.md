# CI CD Process

Coding
Testing -- process of verification to check whether the build software meets its expectation

Unit Testing -- Each individaul module or functionality is testes for the expected result
                test cases are prepared
                test cases to cover max permutation and combination making testing effective
                bugs are fixed and testing is done repeatedly until all bugs are individually fixed


Integration Testing

sequence in which the units are integrated is prepared in the test plan

system integration is an activity wherein different working software units are combined,built,executed

System Testing

it is performed in a simulated env

test cases should cover

external interface

actual volume

performance bound

system test cases are prepared in line with the high level design

Acceptance testing

testing is conducted with the actual env and data and may be taken jointly with customer

random testing

test user-friendliness of system

carried out by someone outside the project
